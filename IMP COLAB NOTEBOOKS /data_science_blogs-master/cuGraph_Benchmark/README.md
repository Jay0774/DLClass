# cuGraph_Benchmark

Part of my [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/4-graph-algorithms-on-steroids-for-data-scientists-with-cugraph-43d784de8d0e) on cuGraph and Rapids.

In my benchmark study, I use three datasets in increasing order of scale from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection. 

1. ego-Facebook: Undirected graph with 4 K nodes and 88 K edges from Facebook 
2. ego-Twitter: Directed graph with 81 K nodes and 1.7 M edges from Twitter
3. ego-Gplus: Directed graph with 107 K nodes and 13.6 M edges from Google+
