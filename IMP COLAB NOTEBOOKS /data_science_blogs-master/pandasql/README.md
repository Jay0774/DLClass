## PandaSQL

Pandas is one of the best data manipulation libraries in recent times. It lets you slice and dice, groupby, join and do any arbitrary data transformation . You can take a look at this post on Pandas which talks about handling most of the data manipulation cases using a straightforward, simple, and matter of fact way.

Though there sometimes are moments when you would like to have  just a bit more. Say you come from a SQL background in which the same operation was too easy. Or you wanted to have a more readable code. Or you just wanted to run an adhoc SQL query on your dataframe.Or, maybe you come from R and want a replacement for sqldf. 

For example, one of the operations that Pandas doesn't have an alternative for is non-equi joins which is really quite trivial in SQL. 

This post is essentially about using SQL with pandas Dataframes.
