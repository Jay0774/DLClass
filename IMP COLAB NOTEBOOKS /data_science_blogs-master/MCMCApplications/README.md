MCMC is a pretty hard topic to wrap your head around but examples do help a lot.

Last time I wrote an article explaining [MCMC methods](https://towardsdatascience.com/mcmc-intuition-for-everyone-5ae79fff22b1) intuitively. In that article, I showed how MCMC chains could be used to simulate from a random variable whose distribution is partially known i.e. we don’t know the normalizing constant.

I also told how MCMC can be used to Solve problems with a large state space. But didn’t give an example.

I will provide some real-world use cases in this post.
If you don’t really appreciate MCMC till now, I hope I will be able to pique your interest by the end of this blog post.
