Hummingbird is a library for compiling trained traditional ML models into tensor computations. Hummingbird allows users to seamlessly leverage neural network frameworks (such as PyTorch) to accelerate traditional ML models.

Thanks to Hummingbird, users can benefit from:

(1) all the current and future optimizations implemented in neural network frameworks;
(2) native hardware acceleration;
(3) having a unique platform to support both traditional and neural network models, and have all of this
(4) without having to re-engineer their models.

Put even more simply; you can now convert your models written in Scikit-learn or Xgboost or LightGBM into PyTorch models and gain the performance benefits of Pytorch while inferencing.
