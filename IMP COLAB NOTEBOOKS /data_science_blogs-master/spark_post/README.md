# Spark Post

This code is part of my post on learning [spark](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-handle-big-data-using-spark-90b9be0fe89a)

You can try to take a look at tryspark.html rather than .ipynb. Somehow the ipython notebook exported from Databricks community server shows all the data in the ipynb and that makes the ipynb a little hard to see.
